Adding new service to the classifier

Step 1: Generate the data set for this service. This can be either real or mockup. This dataset must be in a csv format with only one column called short_description. This column should hold the data for this service. Save this as <service name>Corp.csv. Eg if takara then save as takaraCorp.csv.
Step 2: Save this csv file into the update folder in the resources folder. This folder should be empy apart from this csv. The addService .py file reads the csv from this file and then do the specific steps. 
Step 3: Go the classes folder in src and open the classifierProperties.py file. In this file add the service you wish to add to the services list. And add the integer: service name mapping for this new service into dictX. For example with 3 services dictX contains {‘0’ : ’helpdesk’ , ’1’ : ’taxi’ , ’2’ : ’stock’}. Add takara to dictX  =  {‘0’ : ’helpdesk’ , ’1’ : ’taxi’ , ’2’ : ’stock’ ,   ‘3’ : ‘takara’ }.
Step 4: In the src folder, run the addService.py as follows: python addService.py <service name>, eg python addService.py takara. This code will add the csv to the datasets folder in the resources as well append this data to the fullset.csv file. This file will also generate the vocab set for this service and add it to the necessary files. It will also rebuild the classifier so the service is added to the classifier immediately.
